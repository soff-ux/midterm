# Curating Inspiration

## Description:
Curating Inspiration is a Python project that generates random art images from The Met's collection and random quotes from ZenQuotes. It is supposed to play a role like Pinterest, but unlike that app Curating Inspiration is not, in fact, curated - the randomness of quotes and images refreshes user's thought process.

## Features:
- **Image and Quote Generation**: Fetches art images and quotes via APIs.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Simple interface with buttons to generate art

## Requirements:
- The following points were accomplished for grading:
  - **Uses API**: Fetches data from The Met and ZenQuotes APIs.
  - **Data Validation**: Handles cases where an image cannot be fetched.
  - **Decomposition Principles**: Functions organized for clarity.
  - **README.md and requirements.txt**: Included.

## How to Run:
1. Install the required libraries using `requirements.txt`.
2. Run the script.
